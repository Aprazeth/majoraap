A repository of my tools and scripts

1. Set-Unblock.ps1 - a PowerShell script to automatically unblock downloaded files from your intranet/internet.
2. Backup-EverNoteDatabase.ps1 - a PowerShell script that allows you to make a backup of your EverNote database, and starts your cloud-storage provider (such as DropBox, OwnCloud, Box.net etc.) after having created the EverNote backup. It can be run via the Task Scheduler to make regular and automatic backups.
3. Get-ARMAFileContent.PS1 - a PowerShell script that traverses the folder and subfolders for all ItemList files and extracts the class, quality, and price information into a CSV-file. This script is still in progress/being worked on.
